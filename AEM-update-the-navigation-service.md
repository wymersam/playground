- open this file in your IDE and edit as per requirement
- upload the changed file to the json folder and then activate it. Make sure you delete or replace the old file
 
## Common issues

If you find that the changes did not work then it may be a caching issue.

Taking the first screenshot as an example, you can see the path highlighted for the PDP. This is actually the old path which has been cached:

In the following screenshot, we have cache busted the page (add ? and any random letters after `html` in the url). You can see in the screenshot how to do this. When we do this cache busting, you can see that the new and correct path is now loaded:

In order to resolve this issue, we have to leave a comment to Tobias Menzel on the relevant ticket telling him that the issue is a caching issue and that the cache needs to be flushed.
